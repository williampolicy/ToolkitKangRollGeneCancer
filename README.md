# ToolkitKangRollGeneCancer



## Overview
KangRollGeneCancer is a Python package designed for analyzing the relationships between genes and cancer dynamics. This innovative package delves into the intricate interactions between various genes and their roles in cancer progression, employing the Roll Principle to navigate the complexities of genetic networks. Initiated in June 2023, the project aims to introduce the Roll Principle to a broader audience, with a special focus on the challenging aspects of Uncoding DNA.

By showcasing the application potential and operational methodologies of the Roll Principle, particularly in the context of Uncoding DNA, KangRollGeneCancer sets out to demonstrate the principle's effectiveness in deciphering complex genetic interactions. This endeavor is geared towards contributing significantly to the field of genetic research in oncology. Furthermore, through rigorous stress testing of the Roll Principle, KangRollGeneCancer seeks to establish standardized methodologies for its broader application, thus paving the way for advanced genetic analysis and personalized medical solutions integrated with Electronic Health Records (EHR).


This project not only aims to advance our understanding of gene-cancer dynamics but also strives to lay down a foundational framework for applying the Roll Principle in diverse scientific inquiries, thereby enriching the field of genetic research with new perspectives and tools.


## Installation

To install KangRollGeneCancer, run the following command:

```bash
pip install KangRollGeneCancer
```

## Quick Start

Below is a quick example to demonstrate the basic functionality of KangRollGeneCancer:

```python
import KangRollGeneCancer as krgc
